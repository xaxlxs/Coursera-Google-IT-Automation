    "# Install Pillow\n",
    "\n",
    "We should change the format and size of these pictures, and rotate them by 90° clockwise. To do this, we'll use Python Imaging Library (PIL). Install pillow library using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "> pip3 install pillow\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Imaging Library (known as Pillow in newer versions) is a library in Python that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving lots of different image file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pillow offers several standard procedures for image manipulation. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Per-pixel manipulations\n",
    "Masking and transparency handling\n",
    "Image filtering, such as blurring, contouring, smoothing, or edge finding\n",
    "Image enhancing, like sharpening and adjusting brightness, contrast or color\n",
    "Adding text to images (and much more!)\n",
    "Click Check my progress to verify the objective.\n",
    "Install Pillow\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write a Python script\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the challenge section of the lab where you'll write a script that uses PIL to perform the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate through each file in the folder\n",
    "For each file:\n",
    "Rotate the image 90° clockwise\n",
    "Resize the image from 192x192 to 128x128\n",
    "Save the image to a new folder in .jpeg format\n",
    "Use a nano editor for this purpose. You can name the file however you'd like. And make sure to save the updated images in the folder: /opt/icons/\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use lots of methods from PIL to complete this exercise. You can refer to Pillow for detailed explanations and have a look at the tutorials to help you build the script and complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To save the file after editing, press Ctrl-O, Enter, and Ctrl-x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your script is ready, grant executable permission to the script file.\n",
    "\n",
    "> chmod +x <script_name>.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace <script_name> with the name of your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, run the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ./<script_name>.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace <script_name> with the name of your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a successful run, this should produce images in the right format within the directory: /opt/icons/\n",
    "\n",
    "To view the updated images use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ls /opt/icons\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "ea9afeff1183c231.png\n",
    "\n",
    "To check image properties, use the Python interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "> python3\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the interactive shell opens, import the Image module from PIL:\n",
    "\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "Open any image from the folder, or you can use the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "> img = Image.open(\"/opt/icons/ic_edit_location_black_48dp\")\n",
    "\n",
    "To view the format and size of the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "> img.format, img.size\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "b3a2965a9c783ec9.png\n",
